Spaec Invaedrs
------

A space-invaders-like game made in Unreal Engine 4. Demonstrates some small amount of non-trivial use of the C++ API, which the official docs seem to be lacking.

Note that I didn't add the UE4 starter content because of its size, but the project has a few dependencies on it. Copy `Content/StarterContent` from another project before compiling.
